## Technology Stack & Architecture
This project is built primarily with **C++**, focusing on pure algorithmic implementations. The core "technology" is the **Segment Tree data structure** itself, demonstrating its versatility in solving a variety of array-based problems requiring efficient range queries and updates.

## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
This repository focuses on algorithmic solutions, not a traditional database schema. Below is a conceptual flow diagram illustrating the core operations and architecture of a Segment Tree, which is the central component of this project.

## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
To get these powerful Segment Tree solutions running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/leetcode.git
    cd leetcode/segmentTree
    ```
2.  **Compile a specific solution (e.g., `buildTree.cpp`):**
    ```bash
    g++ buildTree.cpp -o buildTree
    ```
3.  **Run the compiled executable:**
    ```bash
    ./buildTree
    ```
Each `.cpp` file within the `segmentTree` directory is a self-contained solution or implementation of a Segment Tree concept. Feel free to explore and experiment with them!
