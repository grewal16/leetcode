# ðŸ§  LeetCode Solutions by Grewal

Welcome to my personal repository of **LeetCode problem solutions**, written in C++. This repo serves as a structured archive of my solutions categorized by problem type, data structure, or algorithmic technique.

Iâ€™ve started with **segment tree-based problems**, with plans to expand to other categories like trees, dynamic programming, graphs, and more.

## âœ… Whatâ€™s Inside

This repository focuses on:

- ðŸ“Š **Segment Trees**
  - Building segment trees
  - Range sum queries
  - Range minimum/maximum queries
  - Point updates
  - Lazy propagation (upcoming)
  - Use cases in problems like:
    - Range Sum Query
    - Count of Smaller Numbers After Self
    - Range Minimum Query (RMQ)
    - Good Triplets (custom logic using segment tree)

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/grewal16/leetcode.git
   cd leetcode

## Navigate into a topic folder
  cd segmentTree

## Compile and run any .cpp file (example):
  g++ range_sum_query.cpp -o range_sum_query
  ./range_sum_query
