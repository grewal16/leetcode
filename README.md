## Technology Stack & Architecture
This project is primarily focused on **Algorithm Design & Data Structures** implemented in **C++**. The core "architecture" revolves around the **Segment Tree** data structure itself, which provides logarithmic time complexity for range queries and updates. Each C++ file (`.cpp`) represents a standalone implementation of a specific Segment Tree problem or operation, demonstrating modular and efficient coding practices.

## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
While not a traditional database schema, the Segment Tree itself has a distinct logical architecture. Below is a conceptual overview of its operations:

## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
To get started with these Segment Tree solutions, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/leetcode.git
    cd leetcode/segmentTree
    ```

2.  **Compile a Solution (Example: `buildTree.cpp`):**
    Use a C++ compiler like `g++`.
    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++17 -o buildTree buildTree.cpp
    ```

3.  **Run the Executable:**
    ```bash
    ./buildTree
    ```
    Repeat for any other `.cpp` file in the `segmentTree` directory to test different implementations.
