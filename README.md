## Short Description
This repository (`leetcode` by `grewal16`) is presumed to be a personal collection of solutions to algorithmic problems found on LeetCode. Its primary goal is likely to document and organize solutions for various challenges, serving as a reference or a practice log.

**Note:** Due to an unparsable or missing repository file structure in the provided input, the specific contents, technologies, and detailed features of this project cannot be accurately inferred. This README provides a standard structure and placeholder information, indicating where specific project details would be populated given a valid file structure.

## Features
*   Solutions to various algorithmic problems from LeetCode.
*   Organization of problems, potentially by difficulty, topic, or data structure.
*   (Specific features like test cases, performance metrics, or alternative approaches cannot be inferred without the actual file structure.)

## Functionalities
*   **As a Developer/Learner:**
    *   Explore and review solutions to a wide range of algorithmic challenges.
    *   Study different approaches and programming paradigms used to solve problems.
    *   Reference implementations for common data structures and algorithms.
*   (Detailed functionalities such as local execution, testing frameworks, or contribution guidelines cannot be inferred without the codebase structure.)

## Technology Stack & Architecture
The specific technology stack and architectural patterns cannot be determined without the repository's file structure. This section outlines typical components that would be inferred for a repository of LeetCode solutions.

*   **Programming Languages:**
    *   Solutions are typically implemented in one or more common programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, Go). The specific languages used can only be identified by examining file extensions and dependencies.
*   **Development Tools:**
    *   Depending on the languages, basic build/run tools (e.g., `javac`, `python`, `g++`) or package managers (e.g., `pip`, `npm`, `Maven`, `Gradle`) might be utilized.
*   **Architecture:**
    *   For a collection of solutions, the architecture is typically straightforward: a file-based organization where each problem or set of problems resides in its own file or directory. There is generally no complex application architecture (like client-server) unless a specific project is built around these solutions.

## Installation & Usage
Installation and usage instructions are highly dependent on the specific programming languages and structure of the solutions within the repository, which could not be inferred. The following steps provide a general guide for interacting with such a repository:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/leetcode.git
    cd leetcode
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a specific problem solution:**
    Once cloned, you would typically navigate to the directory containing the solution for a particular problem. For example:
    ```bash
    cd python/arrays/two_sum
    # Or: cd java/dynamic_programming/longest_common_subsequence
    ```
    (The exact directory structure and file names would be evident from the repository's actual contents.)

3.  **Run the solution:**
    The command to run a solution depends on the programming language:
    *   **Python (example):**
        ```bash
        python <solution_file_name>.py
        ```
    *   **Java (example):**
        ```bash
        javac <SolutionClass>.java
        java <SolutionClass>
        ```
    *   **C++ (example):**
        ```bash
        g++ <solution_file_name>.cpp -o <executable_name>
        ./<executable_name>
        ```
    *   (If specific test frameworks or build tools are used, additional commands for running tests or building executables would be provided here.)

4.  **Install Dependencies (if any):**
    If any solutions rely on external libraries, you would typically find a `requirements.txt` (Python), `package.json` (Node.js), or `pom.xml` (Java Maven) file. In such cases, you would install dependencies:
    *   **Python:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    *   **Node.js:** `npm install`
    *   (Specific dependency management steps cannot be determined without the file structure.)

## License
A `LICENSE` file was not found or could not be inferred from the provided repository structure. Therefore, the licensing information is omitted.
