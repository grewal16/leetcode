## Technology Stack & Architecture
This project is built purely in **C++**, emphasizing raw algorithmic efficiency and direct data structure manipulation. It leverages the inherent speed and control offered by C++ to deliver high-performance solutions without external frameworks.

## üìä Architecture & Database Schema
While this repository primarily focuses on individual algorithmic solutions rather than a holistic system architecture, the core operations around a Segment Tree can be visualized as a functional flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Input Array (e.g., `vector<int>` )"] --> B{"Build Segment Tree (e.g., `buildTree.cpp` )"};
    B --> C["Segment Tree (Hierarchical Data Structure)"];
    C -- "Range Query (Sum, Min, Max - e.g., `query_sum.cpp` )" --> D["Query Result"];
    C -- "Point/Range Update (e.g., `range_sum_query_mutable.cpp` )" --> E["Updated Tree State"];
    E --> C;
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Deployment
The solutions within this repository are standalone C++ files. There is no complex configuration or deployment setup required. Simply having a standard C++ compiler (like g++) installed on your system is sufficient.

## ‚ö° Quick Start Guide
To get started with any of the solutions:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/leetcode.git
    cd leetcode
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a Solution:**
    Choose any of the problems within the `segmentTree` directory.
    ```bash
    cd segmentTree
    ```

3.  **Compile and Run:**
    Using `g++` (or your preferred C++ compiler), compile the desired solution and then execute it.
    ```bash
    # Example: Compile
    g++ FindBuildingWhereAlice_and_BobCanMeet.cpp -o alice_bob_meet

    # Example: Run
    ./alice_bob_meet
    ```
    You may need to provide input as per the problem's requirements, typically through standard input.
