## Technology Stack & Architecture
This project is built primarily with:
*   **Language:** C++
*   **Core Data Structure:** Segment Tree
*   **Environment:** Designed for standard C++ compilers (e.g., g++)

The architecture centers around the Segment Tree itself, a binary tree used for storing information about intervals or segments. It allows querying for information about any range (e.g., sum, min, max) in `O(logN)` time and updating an element in `O(logN)` time, making it exceptionally efficient for problems involving large datasets and frequent range operations.

## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
While this project doesn't feature a traditional database, the core architectural flow revolves around the Segment Tree data structure. Hereâ€™s a conceptual diagram illustrating its operational flow:

    A["Input Data Array (e.g., Numbers, Elements)"] --> B["Build Segment Tree (O(N) Time)"];
    B -- "Recursive Division" --> C["Leaf Nodes Represent Single Elements"];
    C -- "Merge Upwards" --> D["Internal Nodes Store Aggregates (Sum, Min, Max)"];
    D --> E1["Query Operation (e.g., "Range Sum", "Min", "Max")"];
    D --> E2["Update Operation (e.g., "Modify Element at Index")"];
    E1 -- "Traverse Tree" --> F1["Return Range Query Result (O(logN) Time)"];
    E2 -- "Update Path to Root" --> F2["Segment Tree Updated (O(logN) Time)"];
    F2 --> E1;
    F1 --> G["Problem Solution / Application"];
    F2 --> G["Problem Solution / Application"];
```

## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
To get started with these Segment Tree implementations:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/leetcode.git
    cd leetcode/segmentTree
    ```

2.  **Compile a Specific Solution:**
    Choose any `.cpp` file (e.g., `buildTree.cpp` or `query_sum.cpp`).
    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -O2 buildTree.cpp -o buildTree
    ```

3.  **Run the Executable:**
    ```bash
    ./buildTree
    ```

4.  **Experiment:**
    Modify the C++ files to test different inputs or integrate the Segment Tree logic into your own projects. Each file is self-contained and demonstrates a specific aspect or application of the Segment Tree.
